# Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe project! This simple game allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Getting Started

# Project Structure
The project consists of two main components:

# API (Backend):

* Built with ASP.NET Core 6 Web API.
* Uses MongoDB as a database.

# Frontend:

* Developed with React.
* Communicates with the API to manage game state.

Run the following command to start the project:

```bash
docker-compose up
```
Access the frontend at http://localhost:3000 to play Tic-Tac-Toe.

# Gameplay

Open the application in your browser.
Players take turns clicking on the empty cells to make their moves.
The game will indicate the winner or a draw when the game concludes.
